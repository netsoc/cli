# Netsoc CLI

_`netsoc` allows you to manage your Netsoc account and webspace from the command line!_

## Install

1. Head to [the latest release](https://github.com/netsoc/cli/releases/latest) and grab the binary for your platform.

    - For Linux, choose `cli-linux-amd64` (or `cli-linux-386` if you're on an old 32-bit system!)
    - For Mac, choose `cli-darwin-10.6-amd64`
    - For Windows, `cli-windows-4.0-amd64.exe` (`cli-windows-4.0-386.exe` on 32-bit)
2. On Linux or Mac, do `chmod +x path/to/download/cli-<platform>`
3. Run `path/to/download/cli-<platform>` to access the CLI!
  (On Windows you might need `.\Downloads\cli-windows-4.0-amd64.exe`)

If you're on Arch Linux, there's an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netsoc/).
